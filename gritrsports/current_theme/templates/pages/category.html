Due to the pressures associated with firing 5.56×45mm, you shouldn't fire 5.56×45mm rounds in an AR-15 that is marked as .223 Remington, main reason being that higher pressure might cause damage to the rifle.On other hand, it's safe to use .223 in any 5.56 market AR-15 rifle. However, with enough modifications and adjustments, it's possible to use almost any caliber you can think of: from .17 HMR to .45 ACP and even .50. One of the more popular calibers that have been gaining popularity is .300 BLK - a suppressor-friendly load, excellent for hunting, home defense and short range shooting. Nevertheless, 5.56x45 and .223 Remington remain the most popular options for AR-15."

If you're putting 100 rounds a week at the range, AR-15 barrel is going to last you approximately 15 years, as long as you take good care of your rifle. And even after, considering how easy it is to switch parts in your typical AR-15 - all you have to do is replace the barrel. AR-15 is infamous for its modularity and room for improving and modifying according to your needs."

            "text": "There are 3 options when it comes to barrel length for AR-15: 20-inch, 18-inch and 16-inch. Starting with 20-inch barrel: it's mainly used for hunting and target shooting. Longer barrel provides AR-15 with lighter recoil, extra bullet velocity and greater sight radius. However, a 20-inch barrel makes it much harder to maneuver around and depending on the handguard, makes muzzle heaver. Now, on the other end of the spectrum, there is a 16-inch barrel: a shorter barrel is easy to maneuver and store. In addition to that, it increases the stopping power. In general, 16-inch is the most popular barrel length for AR-15 for home defense, and even though it possesses lower velocity compared to 18 and 20-inch barrels - it doesn't really matter in home defense situations. Now, 18-inch barrel is the least popular option for barrel length, due to it being less compact compared to 16-inch as well as having heavier recoil compared to a 20-inch barrel."

And even though it was true back when AR-15 was first released, it's not as much of a case currently. Most of the problems regarding AR-15 malfunctioning in the extreme environment have been addressed over the last decades, making AR-15 rifles as reliable as AK-47s, if not more so. However, that came at a cost - straight out of the box AR-15 would be on average more expensive compared to a similar AK-47 model. Now, when it comes to power, there is no arguing that the  AK-47 with its 7.62x39mm is much more powerful compared to AR-15's 5.56x45mm. Sadly, that's pretty much the only advantage that AK-47 has over the  AR-15. When it comes to weight, ease of modification, effective shooting range, general ease of access and recoil - AR-15 rifles are simply superior to AK-47 ones."

AR-15 can vary in price by quite a lot: from budget options around 500$ to high-end tactical models that would cost up to 3000$. Standard Mil-spec AR-15 rifles are a great starting point for anyone not experienced with the AR-15 platform. These rifles are great for target shooting and varmint hunting. However, there is always room for improvement and adjusting your rifle to your needs: scopes, floating handrails, adjustable and overall higher quality components can go a long way.  And for the high-end AR-15 rifles, you can expect impeccable quality right out of the box. AR-15 is famous for being extremely modification-friendly: you can start with a decent rifle and over time improve it to fit your needs."

Even though 5.45x39 possesses less penetrating power, it's much more effective against a living target due to higher velocity. There are also more niche AK models that use 5.56x45 and 9mm rounds: pistol caliber rifles are popular among target shooters due to lighter recoil."

When it comes to hats, originally it was mostly bowler hats or sombreros. However, in the 1870s, Stetson hats became popular due to their use in Union Cavalry. To this day, Stetson remains one of the most popular cowboy hat makers in the world.
Cowboy boots are something almost mandatory if you're going for a western look. Instead of being rugged riding boots, modern models are quite comfortable while being an incredible accessory to enhance your look. There is a wide variety of models, with an astounding number of designs, so you would definitely find something fitting you style.
Fringe jackets are also an iconic piece of western wear. There were many subcultures who would take on this piece of original Western culture, but most importanly it's associated with country and folk music. Nevertheless, it stays as amazing piece of western wear style.

				"text": "There are a few key points to consider when wearing western boots:
Make sure that the boots fit you properly. Western boots should feel comfortable around the foot and ankle without restricting the natural movement of your foot.
Wear a good pair of socks. It's important to wear socks that are thick enough to provide cushioning and support, but not so thick that they cause the boots to feel tight or constricting.
Break in the boots: Like any new shoes, western boots might be a bit stiff at first, so it's a good idea to wear them around the house to help break them in and make them more comfortable.
Wear western boots with the right clothing: Western boots are a versatile piece of footwear and can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Pairing them with jeans would give you a more casual look while going for a classic dress or a suit would give you a more elevated look.
Take care of the boots: Since western boots are made of leather, regularly cleaning and conditioning them will help to prolong their life and in general stay in better condition. It's also a good idea to use a boot jack or boot pull to remove the boots, as this will prevent damaging the boots or stretching them out of shape."

A lighter higher velocity bullet may have less stopping power and less penetration, but also reduced recoil, allowing for higher accuracy.

Rimfire ammunition in general usually costs less and produces less noise and recoil. However, due to lighter loading and rimfire cartridge structure, it's not suitable for high power loads, nor it is suitable for reloading. Coupled with a lower range compared to centerfire, rimfire makes for a great option for practice, small game hunting and target shooting.
Centerfire gun ammunition negates most of the performance issues of rimfire: it's more accurate, with a heavier load and produces much higher bullet velocity and is able to be reloaded. However, the average cost of centerfire is comparatively higher. Recoil is much more noticeable as well due to heavier loading.
Generally, both rimfire and centerfire are excellent, just for different things. If all you want is to target shoot and maybe hunt some small game - go with rimfire ammo. If you're planning on hunting big game, while also having an option for home defense - centerfire is going to be your go-to."
